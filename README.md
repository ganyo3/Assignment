Numerically Solving the Time Independent Schrödinger Equation
Computational Physics is the field that combines physics and computer science to solve complex physical problems using numerical methods
It involves the development and implementation of algorithms, computational models, and simulations to study and analyze physical phenomena that cannot be easily solved analytically,such as the Schrödinger Equation.'
The Schrödinger equation describes the behavior of quantum mechanical systems, and its solutions give the wave function of the system, which describes the probability of finding the particle at a particular location and time
